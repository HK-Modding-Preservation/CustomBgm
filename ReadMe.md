# CusotmBgm

This mod enables the use of custom background music in a similar way old versions of CustomKnight did.

## Adding custom music

1. Install the mod
2. Have `.wav` audio files
3. Run the game once and go to the place you want the custom audio in
    1. This generates a folder
    2. This also shows the name of the audio, visible in `Modlog.txt`
4. Exit the game
5. Go to the `CustomBgm` folder
    1. This is located next to the `CustomKnight` folder and also next to mod files
6. Move the audio files here and rename them according to step 3.2.
7. Start the game
8. Go to the place you wanted the audio in, if everything worked correctly, it should be a bit laggy for a short moment, but the audio should play
